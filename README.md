Initialized using [@stackr/sdk](https://www.stackrlabs.xyz/).

It is an Ephemeral Micro-Rollup that can be used as a Scoring System for games like Capture The Flag.

Ephemeral rollups are short-lived i.e. only for the duration of the game but preserve state roots and tx data on the L1 for future retraceability and verifiability of user's data (in this case, game score).
